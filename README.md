# Predicting the Instrinsic Valuation of Fine Art

For long, the art industry has grappled with issues such as industry opacity, data bias, artwork variance, and subjective evaluations, hindering an accurate assessment of an artwork's worth.

Art appraisal remains heavily reliant on the “trained eye”, helmed by external factors beyond the formal qualities of the work; despite the growing availability of sophisticated digital tools which complement traditional qualitative analysis, offering a data-driven alternative. Machine learning-based regression models and neural networks also derive more objective and accurate valuations, assisting art collectors and appraisers in their decision-making. Furthermore, the integration of sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP) facilitate the assessment of an artwork's influence and cultural impact by analyzing textual data from detailed art analysis and public surveys. 

Throughout this project, I aim to integrate the framework of “Critical Questions for Big Data” by Danah Boyd and Kate Crawford with the insights of Diana Greenwald in her project “Painting by Numbers”. Crucially, draw on the research of Jules Prown, who pioneered quantitative analysis in art research. This investigation into the application of digital tools and artificial intelligence (AI) in art analysis intends to address the longstanding challenges in the holistic valuation of art; this fosters a more transparent and informed art market.
