There is a liquid stain at the top left corner, which is likely attributable to the milieu of the artist’s studio. The sheet is structurally sound with some small edge tears and dents. An old tear that crosses the width of the sheet has been well-mended during an earlier restoration procedure through the application of an overall paper lining on the verso surface.The sheet has natural undulations and minor distortions throughout.
